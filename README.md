### Hi, I'm Mateusz ðŸ‘‹:nerd_face:
I'm a junior developer who loves to learn. Recently I'm improving my .NET knowledge and learning Swift language.
I'm interested in NoSQL databases (document and graph are my favourites). I love taking part in hackathlones and creating something original, useful and sometimes funny.
